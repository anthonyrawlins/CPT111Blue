    <p>&ldquo;RMIT&rsquo;s Computer Science program is highly regarded, so that&rsquo;s what really attracted me to study here. The facilities are modern and advanced, giving us access to technology that might be hard to find elsewhere. If you want to gain industry experience and work for big companies here and abroad, RMIT is a good starting point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would recommend Foundation Studies because it gives the students an idea of what taking up the bachelor&rsquo;s degree will be like. My classes are tailored to fit the subjects that I might be taking up in Computer Science, so Foundation Studies gives me the basic knowledge that I might need and it helps me set an expectation of what I&rsquo;ll be dealing with in the next few years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a lot of stress as it eases the students into this idea and it just prepares the students for their chosen future degrees. I have to admit that not being too stressed about my subjects is a good feeling. I like that each subject makes it a point to not throw everything all at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The teachers are really kind, too, and they&rsquo;re very approachable. A standout would have to be the orientation camp because I met a lot of the other students there and I had a lot of fun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like how RMIT is not just focused on educating their students. RMIT makes sure that we get a good university experience by encouraging us to participate in various events, activities and clubs. It&rsquo;s also very diverse, and the students are allowed to be whatever they want to be without any kind of discrimination or judgement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m not studying, I work at a small deli in Queen Victoria Market. The deli sells a wide range of cheese, meat and olives. I work on the weekend since that&rsquo;s only when I&rsquo;m free.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Georgina had doubts about whether Foundation Studies was the right choice but it has turned out to be a great decision.&nbsp; &ldquo;Before I enrolled I thought Foundation was going to be unsupportive to my career, but it turned out to be better than what I had in mind.&nbsp; I learnt more about writing and researching which has been really helpful.&nbsp; The best part is that I now know what to expect in my bachelor program.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be honest I had doubts about whether it was the right choice, but in no time I had so many friends, most of them from different backgrounds, we were all in the same situation of being new, so we could find our feet together.&nbsp; I thought the language barrier would be an issue considering most people prefer to communicate in their first language but we all learnt that English was our common ground and our English has improved a lot since arriving.&nbsp; I also made friends through different groups around the university; The Christian Union and the RMIT Hockey club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Georgina feels that without a doubt Foundation Studies has been a great decision.&nbsp; &ldquo;The course has taught me so many things.&nbsp; If I had not of chose Foundation Studies I think I would have got quite a shock when I started my degree.&nbsp; The teachers are great, they all make sure that we learn and that we enjoy our time in Melbourne.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Regina moved from Singapore to Melbourne after completing high school to pursue her dream of studying Public Relations in Australia.&nbsp; &ldquo;Melbourne has such a good reputation of being multicultural and also being one of the best cities for international students, which is why I chose it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She has been impressed from the beginning, in particular with the orientation camp that allowed her to make friends easily and meet other students from all around the world.&nbsp; &ldquo;The camp was so much fun because I got to know lots of students from different countries.&nbsp; The activities really helped me make friends as I didn&rsquo;t know anyone beforehand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Foundation Studies has three discipline streams as well as a general program.&nbsp; Regina chose to study the general program so it could give her more options after she finished.&nbsp; &ldquo;The general program gives the students more options; you are able to select more electives without being tied into the stream subjects.&nbsp; The program is really suitable for those students who aren&rsquo;t quite sure what they want to study after Foundation.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The knowledge I have acquired through the program has helped me to expand my skills and seek new ways to solve and approach different health and food quality problems,&rdquo; says Laura.</p>
<p>What attracted her to Melbourne was that it is a multicultural city that provides a good living environment for international students and different opportunities to meet people, allowing her to enhance her personal experience. Furthermore, she can gain professional experience also as Melbourne has important research centres.</p>
<p>Laura tells us of her favourite memory of Melbourne: &ldquo;I remember once I took a walk with my husband around Melbourne starting at the Queen Victoria Gardens exploring the ponds, garden beds and art statues; continuing until reaching South Gate of Yarra River enjoying the view, the shops and the food; continuing the walk through the underground bridge towards to Flinders St &hellip; I really want to come back and stay in Melbourne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sister-in-law, being an RMIT graduate herself, told me that RMIT is the best for studying fashion.

<p>&ldquo;I would definitely recommend others to study here as it takes your knowledge to the next level. You get to learn way beyond your expectations. The staff is also amazing: you never feel like a foreigner &ndash; they treat you equally.

    <p>&ldquo;My RMIT experience equipped me with academic knowledge in languages and cultures &ndash; topics I have always been passionate about. At RMIT, I made some lifelong friends coming from different backgrounds, and I believe it helped shape me into an open-minded global citizen.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&ldquo;After graduating from Advanced Diploma of Translating and Interpreting, I was able to work as a professional interpreter and translator. My cross-cultural communication skills developed further in Bachelor of Arts (International Studies) and I found myself falling in love with helping people from non-English-speaking backgrounds settle in Australia. I consequently became an in-house interpreter for the Austin Hospital and Royal Melbourne Hospital.</span></p>

    <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I am training to become a radiation therapist. I chose this career as I wanted a job that was fulfilling and encompassed my love for science. This program was perfect as the knowledge were mainly physics and biology. Due to the nature of the job, we are often in contact with patients that are going through a difficult time in their lives. Helping them through these difficult times and seeing them complete their treatments instils a great sense of satisfaction.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I had prior training in Singapore before deciding to complete my studies in Melbourne. My seniors who had undergone this RMIT program recommended it to me back in Singapore. They had many positive things to say, and that was the main reason I decided to complete my Bachelor with RMIT.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;RMIT has many industrial partners in my field of study and the close collaboration greatly enhanced the program. In particular, placements are especially beneficial as it connects the theory with practical knowledge.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I was very fortunate to fulfil my placement with Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness Centre and Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. During my placement we had to tag along with our mentors and work together with the radiation therapy team. This allowed us to grasp a better understanding of our theory that was taught in school. Placements also hone our communication skills which is an important skill for a radiation therapist. This is because we are often required to communicate critical information to our patients and fellow colleagues.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;During my placements I also received a strong support from my placement mentors and RMIT lecturers. My placement mentors would often check on my understanding and answer my queries. They also ensured that my goals for placements were fulfilled. Their feedback and words of wisdom helped me become a better radiation therapist.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;RMIT Lecturers are approachable and knowledgeable. They strive to nurture us into professionals within our course of study. Some are also clinical practitioners, and that make lessons more fun and interactive since we are able to discuss interesting clinical cases that that lecturers come across.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;During my course of study I made many friends. They were very supportive which made the learning process more enjoyable. My friends are from different cultures and we love to share about our individual cultures especially traditional food. Having a better understanding of different cultures also helped us to better manage our patients during placements.&rdquo;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p>She chose Melbourne for its multicultural hub and most liveable city status, and RMIT for its global reputation.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">Her decision did not disappoint, as she explains, &ldquo;RMIT has a good learning environment and space for students. Staff members are friendly and helpful. I enjoyed every semester as friends were easily made &hellip; There are so many activities students can be involved in and that is what university life is all about.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>What Shuway liked best about Logistics and Supply Chain Management was the number of group assignments. She found this to be important as students &ldquo;learn to work with others &hellip; by working in groups, you will be open-minded for new ideas and learn to be a leader or team player&rdquo;. She also liked the fact that the courses were &ldquo;in-depth&rdquo; and in &ldquo;detail&rdquo;. &ldquo;This program focuses on the practical side with real life cases and not only on the theoretical aspect that make students more analytical and business-minded,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>She was very much involved in the Student-Staff Consultative Committee for her program, as well as being an active volunteer as a Foundation Studies Mentor, Open Day Student Volunteer, and RMIT University Student Union (RUSU) English Workshop Volunteer.</p>
<p>Now Shuway is a graduate, looking forward to using her skills in her new career.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;In China, it is becoming more and more difficult for graduates to find a job due to overpopulation. Having an overseas study experience can help you stand out in job applications because many companies in China are looking for someone who can speak English very well.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I could get the best education in the world rather than if I stayed in my home country. It is a very good opportunity for you to live and study in another country which is very different to the one you grew up in. I get to live alone and learn how to cooperate with other students especially on my assignments.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;At RMIT, students focus on studying daily. They need to work hard every day to get a high distinction in their final mark. While in China, students must pay more attention on studying for their final exam. If you do well then, you pass; it does not work this way at RMIT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to study hard. I often go to the computer lab to practise and sometimes I will have an experiment with my partners in the mechanical lab. There we usually test material in different situations and record the data for analysis. Everything in the university is modern; we get the best support; and we learn a lot.&rdquo;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p>&ldquo;The relationship between the teacher and student is really different to that in China. Lecturers here are more like my friends. Apart from that, I am really fond of the research course. It&rsquo;s really enjoyable to explore something new by yourself.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Our courses are really helpful for future work. Everything we learn from the book can be used in work. We have research to let us know more about the most advanced technology in this field while we learn about a lot of real cases in class.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;LEAD programs helped me a lot when I first came here. LEAD is a program where volunteer mentors help fresh students out to adjust to new life at university. We had a party with nice mentors and teaching staff. We spent an awesome day playing bowling. We got really useful advice on studying and everyday life.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I went on a wonderful study tour to Indonesia during a summer holiday. This study tour was part of the summer course: low carbon development. I applied online and luckily received a scholarship from the college so it was free!&nbsp; It was really cool because we had to cooperate with students from other majors such as project management, planning, and even media. We stayed in a local village called Puton for two weeks. Most houses in Puton have been ruined by the earthquake, so we designed a new library for the children in Puton and nearby village. It was really meaningful. Apart from that, we experienced the local life, from having lunch in the house of the village chief to planting rice seedlings in the rice field.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I learnt a lot from my experience at RMIT. Innovation is the most important thing I learnt. Everything that we have in our world is born from innovation. Just like how RMIT has attractive buildings in the city, RMIT students have the most attractive idea compared to others.&rdquo;</p>

  </blockquote>
  
  <div class="extended-desc not-hidden">
    <p>&ldquo;I wanted to study overseas not only to enrich my academic education, but also to enrich my life with other cultures, customs and food. I decided to move to Melbourne because Australia is a multicultural country, and RMIT had the program that I most liked.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;For more than 3 years I was looking for a Master that could combine aviation with aerospace &ndash; something my program does. This program appealed to me because it was an innovative and interesting program, focusing on the aviation needs in the Asia-Pacific region, the fastest-growing zone in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far it has been an amazing experience thanks to the quality of the lectures, the knowledge of the professors and their willingness to share their industry experiences. Plus, the assignments are very focused on what I would like to do after finishing this program. I&rsquo;ve had to do group assignments involving creating an airline from scratch, and investigating airplane accidents trying to uncover what went wrong and how to prevent future accidents.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I like how RMIT has a mix of the academic and industrial world. Almost all my professors here have a background in industry or currently work in the aviation industry. They can give you an actual perspective of what is going on out there, what are the problems they face on a daily basis and potential problems. I like how they teach us how to identify potential problems that could impact safety &ndash; because at the end of the day, what matters most is that the airplane arrives at its destination in a safe and secure way. I did an internship in an airline back home, working as a repair engineer providing repair procedures for airplane engines, so I find this program very interesting.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;This program is preparing me a lot for my future career. I can identify hazards that might jeopardise the safety and security of the airplane, the probability of its occurrence, what is going on inside an airline, how an airline works and how to be competitive in this tough market. I also get to think about the sustainability side of aviation. I&rsquo;m learning that the aviation industry is trying to reduce its impact on our environment, as well as cut operational expenses. I don&rsquo;t know what to focus on my future career &ndash; everything seems appealing to me. I just love it all.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I am on a scholarship from the Mexican government, but this scholarship does not cover all the tuition expenses, so RMIT supported me with the rest of the money that I needed. When I first arrived, I was worried about how I was going to pay the rest, but later when I was informed about the RMIT support, it made my day. Now I can focus 100% on my studies and I&rsquo;m very thankful for that.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to an RMIT Spanish Club meeting and it was a pleasant surprise for me to meet so many Aussies fluent in Spanish and interested in Latino culture. Several had visited my country and other countries in South America, and it was nice to hear their experiences &ndash; about the places I loved to visit, the unforgettable food and the differences they&rsquo;ve found between here and there.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;In Melbourne, I get to meet and work with people from all over the world, especially Asia. Mexico isn&rsquo;t influenced much by the Asian culture so it was an amazing surprise when I first arrived in Melbourne to see the influence Asian culture has over the city. Trying different types of food from different countries is what I love most about the city. I actually went to Vietnam because I loved the food that I tried here. So far it&rsquo;s one of my favourite, and I thought that if it was tasty here, it will be tastier at the original place &ndash; and indeed it was!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Studying postgraduate art constantly challenges you to explore outside of your comfort zone and investigate new findings.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <div class="extended-desc not-hidden">
    <p>"I spent seven years in commercial art working as a set designer, an&nbsp;illustrator and an art instructor, so I wanted to explore the other aspect&nbsp;of art practice, where critical analysis and in-depth investigation into&nbsp;the core of your practice are explored.</p>
<p>"The Master of Fine Art is structured in a way that allows ample room for&nbsp;experimentation, which is important to fine art practice. You are narrowing&nbsp;your focus down to the condensed core of what you want to say.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">"The teachers at RMIT would constantly challenge me to explore new media and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">techniques. I started off using illustration as my medium, then shifted to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">sculpture before refining to taxidermy.</span></p>
<p>"I love that I can combine both of these media in my career. I&rsquo;m currently&nbsp;working as a children's book author and illustrator while continuing to&nbsp;exhibit my taxidermy work in galleries in Melbourne and overseas.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;At RMIT, I had some of the best lecturers I have had in my entire studying life. I still remember one lecturer Michael Manh telling us that if you know your basics, you can learn or do anything in the future. I have always tried my best to stick to the basics for the past 10 years of my work and it has helped me a lot to achieve things at work and in my personal life.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&ldquo;I started in Telstra in 2004 as a consultant in one of their contact centres. My vision was to start from the lowest level to one day rise in the ranks of the company and land my dream job as a Radio Frequency (RF) Engineer.</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&ldquo;Early 2005, I became an RF Engineer in Telstra&rsquo;s Wireless Network Engineering team working on 2G, 3G, 4G and now 4GX technologies. In my current role, I am responsible for planning and designing LTE and WCDMA networks, providing cost-effective and innovative design solutions and consultations on strategy, preparing coverage maps, and responding to emergency base station requests about natural disasters like bushfires and floods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&ldquo;Once a mobile base station/site becomes integrated in the live network, it gives me a sense of achievement and satisfaction knowing that customers in the new coverage area can actually communicate with the rest of the world, making their life easier. Also working in such a culturally diverse office makes the job fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&ldquo;Since I was a child, I was always intrigued by how people living miles apart could speak on a telephone and have normal conversation. This two-way communication technology fuelled my interest in this career path. Also my belief that communication is the base of everything led me to choose masters in telecommunication engineering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&ldquo;Working life differs a lot from the student life. When you&rsquo;re studying you only try to learn for the course and achieve good scores, but working is a more hands-on experience that teaches you a lot about everything in life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&ldquo;Always set a goal and try your best to achieve no matter how long it takes. Always pursue your dreams.&rdquo;</span></p>

    <p>&ldquo;In Oman, I worked in Sohar Hospital&rsquo;s medical laboratory for the Ministry of Health. I took study leave to further my practical skills, English and communication skills, and learn to be independent. My friends who studied at RMIT recommended I come to Melbourne.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I did my Graduate Diploma in Laboratory Medicine at RMIT first and decided to continue studying here for a PhD because I found a good supervisor and the research topic I was looking for &ndash; cancer research.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;RMIT is different to other universities because there is a focus on the practical side of laboratory medicine in addition to the theoretical side. I get training in hospitals; the courses and facilities are of good quality; the teachers and supervisors are helpful; and there are special supporting courses and social activities available for international students. I already recommended RMIT to my colleagues, and now there are three who are doing their masters here.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel at home in Melbourne, especially Sydney Road, because of the many Arabic restaurants and shops. The shop signs are in Arabic, and you can find Arabic meals, sweets and coffee. I like Melbourne because of how multicultural it is. You can always find mosques for Muslims to pray in, and many Halal food stores.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Melbourne is not only good for me, but my family as well. My family is benefiting from Melbourne&rsquo;s good weather, high quality of healthcare, preschool care and education. My daughter is studying in grade one in a school of 52 different nationalities. Also Bundoora is a nice and quiet area to live in. What a great environment for studying.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I decided to take up doctoral training overseas because I thought it would help me understand what internationalisation of higher education really is, how it should be positioned in the context of Vietnam and to what extent it can support student learning and improve graduate outcomes.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;My research is in the contribution of cross-border higher education to human resource development in Ho Chi Minh City. I was in a teaching position in the public higher education sector in Vietnam for 15 years, so I am passionate about being able to make positive changes to Vietnamese students&rsquo; study experience and level of skill after graduation.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Melbourne was my city of choice as I have an uncle here. However, what&rsquo;s more significant to me is that Melbourne has a large Vietnamese community, which I thought would be easier for my family to settle in, especially my young daughter.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I chose RMIT to do my PhD project for two reasons: the expertise of my supervisor, and the convenience of the city campus. The short travel time allows me to better focus on my study and care for my daughter.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I once participated in the Foundation Studies Mentoring Program and found it was very useful for me in terms of both research and practice in international education. My role was to find mentors and mentees, provide training for mentors and organise events to support and engage newly-arrived international students. Through this experience, I was able to learn a lot about customer service in international education. It opened up my eyes to good practice in international education.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I started with a Masters at RMIT with a thesis component where I was able to develop my analytical skills. I found I had enjoyed every moment of it! This made me apply for a PhD position and scholarship at RMIT. I also enjoyed working with my supervisors and wanted to continue in that collaboration.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;My study has given me both practical knowledge in my field and a thorough grounding in academic skills which will help me whether I am in the academic field or industry. Apart from technical knowledge, I have also learned to persevere and not give up when something doesn&rsquo;t work out, and ask for help if necessary.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I would recommend RMIT because there is a lot of support for students &ndash; academic and social. I was active in the MATES program which mentors new international students helping them adjust to studying at RMIT and living in Melbourne. I also lead a team of mentors, guiding them in how to best work with their mentees.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I left my job, my friends and community in New South Wales to for this PhD. I felt privileged and delighted to gain entry to this program at RMIT because it is well-known for taking good care of international students. I personally have seen my friends enjoy being a part of RMIT.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was working in the community service field in New South Wales, I noticed there was lack of awareness around mental health and wellbeing.

<p>&ldquo;I also work as a sessional bilingual mental health educator, running educational sessions and courses to the community and health workers in Arabic and English. My dream is to lead national campaigns around this area as well. I will continue studying for this purpose. My experience at RMIT has made me want to do so much more!<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;RMIT has been great &ndash; the study facilities offered to Higher Degree by Research candidates are excellent, the School of Global, Urban and Social Studies provides a supportive environment, and the team of researchers is unique. There are countless free workshops and training offered to students beside the daily interactions with other researchers. RMIT has an understanding of each individual&rsquo;s needs, whether he or she needs study support, counselling or advice from health and wellbeing officers.&rdquo;</p>

  </blockquote>
  
  <div class="extended-desc not-hidden">
    <p>&ldquo;The uni has a good name internationally and also offers a course that is very close to my course in Germany. It is also located right in the city of Melbourne which makes going to uni a fun experience within vibrant surroundings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As an urban planner, Joran finds it interesting to see planning regulations and practices in Australia and to compare them to those in Germany. He appreciates RMIT&rsquo;s &ldquo;very hands-on and practical approach&rdquo; and believes that studying here has broadened his &ldquo;understanding of all kinds of issues within planning and environmental studies&rdquo; which he will be able to apply to his future career, &ldquo;wherever in the world that might be&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think anyone would benefit from a semester or more at RMIT,&rdquo; he says, and also adds, &ldquo;Exchange to Australia will look good on my CV&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Joran&rsquo;s ideal day in Melbourne includes delicious brunch and fantastic coffee in cafes hidden in the alleys of Fitzroy and Collingwood, riding his bike along the Yarra and Merri Creek to hang out with his friends in Brunswick, and eating out at a cheap eatery before checking out an exhibition opening or other cultural events.</p>
<p>But the highlight of Joran&rsquo;s experience in Melbourne was his trips outside the city to Mornington Peninsula, the Great Ocean Road, the Dandenongs and the Grampians. &ldquo;Melbourne is surrounded by beautiful nature,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever get sick of it.&rdquo;</p>
