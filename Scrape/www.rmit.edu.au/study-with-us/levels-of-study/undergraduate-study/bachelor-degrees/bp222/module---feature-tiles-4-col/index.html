    <div class="extended-desc not-hidden"><p>The Innovation in Modern Journalism course will be trialled at RMIT's <a href="http://www.rmit.edu.au/about/our-education/academic-schools/media-and-communication/">School of Media and Communication</a>&nbsp;and the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) this year, with a view to permanent inclusion in the journalism programs from 2016.</p>
<p>The industry-based course links students with day-to-day newsroom challenges.</p>
<p>Students will be challenged to find new ways to engage with audiences at a time of great flux within the media industry, with media consumers migrating to modern, mostly digital, platforms.</p>
<p>Deputy Dean of Media in the School of Media and Communication, Associate Professor Lisa French, said the program would be a significant advantage for RMIT students.</p>
<p>"The students will gain networks, hands-on knowledge, and potentially mentors," she said.</p>
<p>"Students will have a direct line to industry personnel, and will have insights into current change and issues within the journalism profession from the inside."</p>
<p>As part of the collaboration, third-year <a href="../../bp220/index.html">Bachelor of Communication (Journalism)</a>&nbsp;students will work with Fairfax on the trial curriculum, which will focus on innovation in modern journalism.</p>
<p>Fairfax staff, including journalists as well as Fairfax CEO and Managing Director Greg Hywood, will engage directly with students to make presentations and answer questions.</p>
<p>Fairfax Media national news director Sean Aylmer said newsrooms were changing rapidly to meet audience demand so it was important journalism students were aware of the challenges they would be expected to face in their future workplaces.</p>
<p>"New roles are emerging to effectively manage the daily news cycle, and each specialist has their own set of challenges," he said.</p>
<p>"We feel it is important for journalism students to be aware of these challenges so they feel comfortable with the innovation process, modern storytelling techniques, and emerging news platforms.</p>
<p>"Newsroom management has changed. We realise that young journalists in many cases will be the drivers of technology. Their ideas are critical to the success of our business."</p>
<p>Associate Professor French said the collaboration was a cutting-edge, industry-engaged activity that RMIT's competitors would not be able to duplicate.</p>
<p>"In identifying RMIT, Fairfax is indicating that they hold our degree, and our graduates, in the highest regard," she said.</p>
<p>"This opportunity was not offered to any other Victorian universities."</p></div>

For ease of reference typist refers to him as the &ldquo;male student&rdquo;. The deep male voice used early in the video is possibly from the Information machine.

<p>VISUAL: Video of male standing beside the shop front window display of five old televisions including the one seen previously. The camera is side‑on to the man and the shop front window. The televisions are displayed in a neat triangle‑shaped pile and all television screens are displaying the same image of the RMIT female broadcaster speaking which then changes to an image of RMIT&rsquo;s logo and then excerpts of a video for the Communication degree showing two people acting with the word producer in the centre of each television&rsquo;s screen and then an image of a video camera with the word creative at the centre of each screen.</p>

<p>VISUAL: Same image as before of the old style telephone screen but now it&rsquo;s displaying a video of people walking down a footpath in the city with the word Media Buyer across the screen. The back of the male&rsquo;s left shoulder is just to right of screen in the foreground.</p>
<p>Female voice: ... your path.</p>
<p>VISUAL: The male finishes looking at the television screens in the display window and walks away off‑screen.</p>
<p>Female voice: RMIT&nbsp;...</p>
<p>VISUAL: Video pans across the fa&ccedil;ade of the Swanston Academic Building as the male skates from the right of the screen and stops in the centre. He flicks up his skateboard, grabs the front end and stands looking with his back to the camera at the Swanston Academic Building. People in the background are walking on the footpath near the entrance to the Swanston Academic Building and two people walk across Swanston Street.</p>
<p>Female voice: ... prepares you for all types of roles whether in a large firm&nbsp;...</p>
<p>VISUAL: Camera pans down a section of the fa&ccedil;ade of the Swanston Academic Building and stops to focus on the portico area which has the RMIT logo on its glass railing. The back of the male&rsquo;s head looking up at the Swanston Academic Building is to the right of screen in the foreground. The top section of a tram passes along Swanston Street between the camera and the male and Swanston Academic Building.</p>
<p>Female voice: ... a small consultancy or an independent production. Even as a specialist&nbsp;...</p>

<p>VISUAL: Video of male student carrying his skateboard and wearing headphones as he crosses Swanston Street towards the entrance to Swanston Academic Building. The screen fades and the RMIT University logo is laid on top of this video image and underneath that the text: CRICOS provider number: 00122A.</p>
<p>Female voice: ... as a communication professional.</p>
<p>VISUAL: Same image as before of male student walking across road to Swanston Street with RMIT University logo overlaid on that video. Then the screen fades to black.</p>

    <div class="extended-desc not-hidden"><p>Kempson is flying to Sydney this month for an internship with Vogue &ndash; something she doubts would have happened if she hadn&rsquo;t taken up an <a href="https://mentoring.rmit.edu.au/about">RMIT industry mentorship</a>&nbsp;during her studies.</p>
<p>As one of six students mentored by RMIT alumnus and Newscorp CEO Robert Thomson, she was able to join her fellow students to chat with the global media leader every three months in an online forum.</p>
<p>But Kempson, <span>who graduated with a&nbsp;</span><a href="../index.html">Bachelor of Communication (Professional Communication)</a>&nbsp;last year<span>,&nbsp;</span>was also lucky enough to go one step further and tour the offices of the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> with Thomson in New York.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thinking of the [industry mentorship] experience as just an &lsquo;added extra&rsquo; to my education is a grand understatement,&rdquo; Kempson says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was rewarding on so many levels and I would tell any student to give one a shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here she shares more about the value of industry mentoring&nbsp;and how to make the most of the opportunities it can lead to.</p>
<p><strong>What was one of the first things you learned from getting to chat with Robert?</strong></p>
<p>Honestly, and it sounds like such a nagging high school teacher thing to say, but I definitely learned to plan my questions and be prepared.</p>
<p>My fellow mentees and I worked together to come up with concise, set questions in order to make the most of every one of the 60 minutes spent with Robert in the forum.</p>
<p>Simply&nbsp;<em>looking</em>&nbsp;prepared is also a plus; it&rsquo;s awkward to scramble around for something extra to drive conversation. After all, for the most part it&rsquo;s generally the mentee who&rsquo;s responsible for governing the direction and structure of each session.</p>
<p>From Robert we gained a global and corporate perspective on how digital technologies are shaping the news industry, and found out about the status and demands of the current job market. That kind of firsthand insight is one of the best things students could take from getting a mentor of their own.</p>
<p><strong>How would you advise students to make the most of an industry mentorship?</strong></p>
<p>It might be obvious, but it&rsquo;s an absolute no-no to ask your mentor outright for a job. They&rsquo;re there to give you advice on how to get employed, not to employ you.</p>
<p>I was really lucky because I was studying abroad and living in North America for almost the entire duration of the mentorship, which made for an entirely different experience than if I&rsquo;d been in Melbourne.</p>
<p>So the tour of the Wall Street Journal happened pretty organically. The conversations in the online sessions were always stilted by technical glitches and awkward time delays. It was annoying but it turned out to be another factor towards getting such an awesome opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>So, what happened? </strong></p>
<p>Well, the system fully crashed. It was the second mentorship session, and for five minutes the CEO of News Corp and I were the only ones present in our regular Google Chat. Seeing as Robert was in New York at the time, North America naturally fell into the conversation.</p>
<p>It was only moments before Vietnam and Australia tuned back in that Robert very generously offered me the exclusive tour. Only a seven-hour drive away, it wasn&rsquo;t out of the question to drop by Sixth Avenue for a quick &ldquo;hello&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The moral of this story is to let things happen naturally. If they&rsquo;re meant to, they will.</p>
<p><strong>So strategy and networking played a pretty important role in going from student to Vogue intern?</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting you draw up a strategic plan on how to win friends and influence people.</p>
<p>Be receptive, and only act if the timing is right. My chat with Robert at the Journal was cut short when his assistant alerted us that his next meeting, lunch with &ldquo;the ambassador&rdquo;, had been pushed forward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d planned on asking Robert about internship opportunities but had run out of time. Instead, I wrote a follow-up thank you note to his assistant who had kindly coordinated the tour, and showed my initiative there.</p>
<p>After months of email correspondences and patiently trusting that things would work out, I finally secured myself the internship at Vogue.</p>

    <div class="extended-desc not-hidden"><p>The recent <a href="http://www1.rmit.edu.au/courses/038673">Interdisciplinary Communication Project (ICP)</a>&nbsp;study tour took 10 students from Australia to meet 14 of their colleagues in the <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.vn/">RMIT Vietnam</a>&nbsp;Professional Communication degree.</p>
<p>The group worked on a collaborative project producing new strategies for Hanoi City campus to attract more exchange students from Melbourne.</p>
<p>Over an intensive two weeks, students had to develop creative communication strategies and produce some prototype tools to use in the campaigns to present to the University&rsquo;s stakeholders.</p>
<p>Tim Costigan, Head of the Professional Communication Department and one of the ICP course lecturers, believes the study tour has so far been an overwhelming success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have put Melbourne and Hanoi RMIT students together in a &lsquo;hot lab&rsquo; where they must perform fast creative and fast execution under industry-type conditions,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The students have formed project working groups across cultural and disciplinary lines and have already produced strategies and draft prototype communication tools.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's been amazing watching these groups form and perform and to see how well the students are adapting to these exciting but tough conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Melbourne student Madison O&rsquo;Riordan said the emphasis on learning about her Hanoi counterparts&rsquo; culture through the project has improved her understanding of Vietnamese work ethic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My experience with the study tour so far has been one of collaboration and learning in all senses of the word,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been so easy to immerse myself in the Hanoi lifestyle and by working and socialising with my Vietnamese peers I am better able to understand the culture and the work ethic of people that are different from myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The food has been great, but the people have been even better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hanoi student Hien Nhu agreed that the cross-culture collaboration has uncovered the similarities between him and his colleagues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Working on how to attract Melbourne students to go to Hanoi gives me chances to explore aspects of Melbourne students' lifestyle such as their favourite social activities and cuisine,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I found out that we have many things in common, such as the 'coffee culture' &ndash; we love to hang out with friends at beautifully designed cafes.&rdquo;</p>

    <div class="extended-desc not-hidden"><p>The pair are among RMIT&rsquo;s first group of <a href="http://www1.rmit.edu.au/students/ncpscholarships">New Colombo Plan Scholarship</a>&nbsp;exchange students and have almost completed their semester in Ho Chi Minh City.</p>
<p>Overwhelmingly they have enjoyed the fast pace of life in the city, visiting HCMC&rsquo;s famed coffee shops, savouring Vietnamese food, shopping at markets, socialising with friends and even stumbling across an unexpected street festival</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t live in Melbourne&rsquo;s CBD so it&rsquo;s been fun going out, enjoying the food; you wouldn&rsquo;t find a street festival happening in Ivanhoe where I live,&rdquo; Ross, a <a href="http://www.rmit.edu.au/study-with-us/levels-of-study/undergraduate-study/bachelor-degrees/bp252/">Bachelor of Business (Marketing)</a> student, said.</p>
<p>The two say that among fellow exchange students, going further afield than Asia is seen as desirable.</p>
<p>But for these young women, living in such a different culture, among Vietnamese people and French interns rather than fellow exchange students, has been an enlightening experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d have more down time so I brought three books which I haven&rsquo;t read,&rdquo; Ross said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been busy exploring the city, having fun &ndash; and I&rsquo;ve still got a lot to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As far as study goes, Ross has easily been able to slot into RMIT Vietnam&rsquo;s marketing subjects.</p>
<p>Papaioannou, who is studying a <a href="../index.html">Bachelor of Communication (Professional Communication)</a>,&nbsp;has chosen design electives to boost her creative skills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was excited to do something different from my studies and my time in Vietnam has been a huge creative outlet,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gathered art materials at art shops all over the city, started a travel blog and improved my photography.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both third year students, the pair see differences and similarities between studying in Melbourne and HCMC.</p>
<p>With two Australian tutors in Vietnam, Papaioannou has found student life not too different from home but Ross&rsquo; experiences are strikingly different.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vietnamese students study in groups a lot more. They work in groups in areas we&rsquo;d not think of in Australia, maybe because English is not their first language and they need to understand what they&rsquo;re doing through discussion,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also find classes very quiet; I&rsquo;m the loudest person!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Papaioannou, on the other hand, has found her classes very similar to those in Melbourne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as one person speaks up others feel more comfortable to talk,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I enjoy Vietnamese people&rsquo;s sense of humour, it&rsquo;s unexpected and hilarious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the two young women there have been highs and lows; a negative encounter in Ben Thanh Market left Papaioannou pondering how best to relate to Vietnamese people &ndash; until a chance conversation about Vietnam&rsquo;s history with an old man on a park bench left her revitalised.</p>
<p>Ross, who had been to Vietnam before, enjoyed the contrast of a visit to Dalat, Vietnam&rsquo;s veggie garden of the central highlands: cooler and rural.</p>
<p>Overall the young women have found the Vietnam experience exciting and revitalising &ndash; and they&rsquo;re ready to recommend it to others as a first choice study exchange.</p>
<p>They believe the second year of a university degree is the most suitable time to do an exchange and believe the choice should be promoted more to first year students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;A friend who visited me here in HCMC was so impressed that she now wants this experience,&rdquo; Papaioannou said.</p>

  <div class="extended-desc not-hidden">
    <p class="p1">I knew the media and communication field was diverse, but I knew I&rsquo;d be able to hone in on my interest areas while studying this degree. I was passionate about writing, presenting, editing and strategising, so I took subjects across advertising, public relations, journalism and media.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">RMIT places emphasis on enhancing theoretical knowledge with practical experience, so being involved with industry-based work experience has been a priority for me since day one.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.571em;">Last year I participated in a study tour at RMIT&rsquo;s Ho Chi Minh City campus in Vietnam. Not only did I have the chance to collaborate on projects with Ho Chi Minh City and Melbourne students, but I was also able to learn about the Vietnamese culture and media landscape.</span></p>
<p class="p1">I&rsquo;ve also interned across a range of organisations and have been involved in social media managing, creating news packages and writing feature articles for university publications. In 2015 I interned at RMIT University as a Communication and Events Assistant.</p>
<p class="p1">Because Professional Communication is such a broad and all-encompassing degree, students are prepared to work in various professions within the media and communication industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Overall, the opportunities I&rsquo;ve had to study abroad, work with a diverse range of students and constantly undertake industry work experience have all contributed to my global and driven outlook.</p>
